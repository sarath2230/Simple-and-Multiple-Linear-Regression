# Task 3 â€“ Linear Regression: House Price Prediction

This task focuses on implementing **Simple** and **Multiple Linear Regression** models using Scikit-learn to predict house prices based on features like area, bedrooms, and bathrooms.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
To understand how linear regression works for predicting continuous variables and evaluate its performance using proper metrics and visualizations.

## ðŸ“Š Key Steps

- Implemented:
  - **Simple Linear Regression** (with one feature: area)
  - **Multiple Linear Regression** (with multiple features: area, bedrooms, bathrooms)
- Evaluated the model using:
  - **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
  - **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**
  - **RÂ² Score**
- Visualized actual vs predicted values using scatter plots and bar charts.

## ðŸ“ˆ Libraries Used
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## âœ… Conclusion
Including multiple features significantly improved the model's ability to predict house prices. This task helped strengthen understanding of regression modeling and how feature selection impacts performance.
